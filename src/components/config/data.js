The story starts with a notice written in Korean on a billboard, claiming the king of Joseon is dead and the crown prince should be crowned immediately as the new king. However, inside the palace, the king is known to be severely sick and has been secretly treated for the past 10 days. No one was allowed to visit the king, not even the crown prince himself. Late at night, the crown prince sneaks out to visit his father, wanting to know the truth. But instead of his own father, he encountered the silhouette of a beastly monster. Accompanied by the physician Seo-bi (Bae Doo-na), the enigmatic Yeong-sin (Kim Sung-kyu), and his personal guard Mu-yeong (Kim Sang-ho), Prince Lee Chang must prevent the advance of the plague towards his home capital of Hanyang (present-day Seoul) while addressing the sinister coup masterminded by Minister Cho Hak-ju (Ryu Seung-ryong) and his family aimed towards his deposition from the throne."

			"Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school student in the rural town of Itomori, Japan. Bored of the town, she wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. Soon, she begins to intermittently switch bodies with Taki Tachibana, a boy from Tokyo. On certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each other's bodies and must live the entire day as the other, reverting when they go to sleep at night. The two set up ground rules for sharing their bodies, communicating via messages on paper, their phones, and their skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker, Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) helps Mitsuha become more popular at school. While in Mitsuha's body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to the Shinto shrine on a mountain near Itomori, leaving an offering of kuchikamizake made with Mitsuha's saliva. Hitoha explains that god is the ruler over both time and the connections between humans. Mitsuha tells Taki that the comet Tiamat is expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, Taki goes on the date with Miki in his own body; Miki enjoys the date but says she can tell Taki is preoccupied with someone else.

When they arrive, they find the town almost entirely decimated by fragments that fell from Tiamat. Since the comet passed three years earlier, Taki realizes that he and Mitsuha were separated by three years, her living in 2013 and he in 2016. He finds Mitsuha's name among the 500 people killed by the comet's impact. Taki begins to lose his memories of Mitsuha, seeing her messages disappear from his phone. In a panic, he races to the shrine and drinks the kuchikamizake. He has a vision and recalls that Mitsuha once came to Tokyo to find him; though he did not recognize her, she gave him a red kumihimo ribbon he has worn ever since. Taki awakens in Mitsuha's body on the morning of the festival, where Hitoha speaks directly to him, explaining that the body-switching phenomenon has always been in their family. Realizing he has a chance to save Mitsuha and the entire town, Taki convinces Mitsuha's friends to help him broadcast an emergency signal, evacuating Itomori before the meteor fragments strike. He then heads to the shrine, where Mitsuha has just woken up in Taki's body. As twilight falls;[note 1] their timelines cross, allowing them to meet in person for the first time.

After his father's death, he became his family's breadwinner and travels to the nearby village to sell charcoal. One day, Tanjiro comes home to discover his family was slaughtered by a demon. His sister Nezuko is the sole survivor of the incident; though she has been transformed into a demon, Nezuko still shows signs of human emotion and thought. Following an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is sent to train with Giyu's former instructor Sakonji Urokodaki in becoming a Demon Slayer and begins his quest to help Nezuko turn into a human again." +

One of their assignments bring them to Asakusa where they encounter Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one responsible for the murder of their family. Tanjiro and Nezuko also meet Tamayo and Yushiro, two demons free from Muzan's control.

As Zenitsu kills Kaigaku, Tamayo injects Muzan with a poison she and Shinobu have made to weaken his abilities.

As Leviathan requires payment in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zürich via a commercial airliner. As part of the deal for clean records for Cyrus and all his members, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol." +
			"" +
			"The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold via the jet." +

			"Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. After successfully diverting the plane, Jorgenson's henchmen attempt an hijack, resulting in a fight on board the plane. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany." +
			"" +
			"Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry, the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila to get a message to the pilots that there are hostages on board, forcing them to stand down. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa." +

			"Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus." +
			"" +
			"Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby rekindle their relationship."

			"In some areas, everything has its time, but there are exceptions to the rule. The same rule applies to the activities of adventurers. It is believed that only in youth does it make sense to try yourself in this field, and all because in a certain age range it is easier to accumulate magical power and replenish strength. But with growing up and especially approaching maturity, it is much more difficult to cope with such tasks. Often, such attempts turn out to be a failure. Risks do not frighten a thirty-year-old guy who dreams of himself as an adventurer and intends to become one despite all obstacles. The resistance on this path is quite high, because he meets more skeptics than like-minded people. Rick Gladiator, due to the fact that he has nerves of steel and self-confidence, managed to please adventurers who have reached rank S, since they impartially assessed the potential of a strong guy. Of course, his age confused them a little, but he will definitely be able to serve them. And Rick takes on training that lasts for two years. During this period of time, he had to experience wild fatigue. But he did not give up, and continued on his way to get the E rank."

			"There is an incredible architectural structure in the world in the form of a giant tower, which is located almost in the middle of the world. A legend is associated with this tower, as if the one who climbs to the roof will be able to fulfill any wish. Getting there is not so easy, since this requires not only courage, but also some kind of permission. To obtain it, you must go through a rather rigorous selection, during which it is necessary to complete the most difficult tasks that test candidates for ingenuity, dexterity and physical strength. In addition, the participants in the selection must show toughness, will and even demonstrate ambition. Those who are eager for victory should be prepared to kill someone who could have been an ally yesterday. On the way to the top of the tower, betrayal is not seen as something reprehensible, on the contrary, it becomes a completely necessary quality. After the selection has passed, there are many dead. But those who managed to survive get the right to try to climb to the top and fulfill their most cherished dream. On this path, young creatures who were not fully prepared for this will test their strength. Agero Agnis Kun, Wang Nan Ja, Rachel and other children are drawn into the game."
